            <h2><br><br>Some of us had basic dads growing up. Some of us know basic dads now.
                Perhaps some of us have even slipped into being a basic dad without even knowing.
                For many guys, as we age, there is some worry about becoming this “basic dad.” <br> <br>We want to
                be a good parent, but don’t want to fit that stereotype of a goofy or weird or boring dad; as so often seen in the media. <br><br>
                The struggle is real. <br><br>
                Maybe we want to take some of the good things taught by our own dads.  ... But we don’t want to become him.
                Telling lame jokes. Worried about trivial things such as our lawn, or the thermostat setting in our house.
                We're better than that. ...Right? We are cool, more modern, and definitely have better style. 
                <br><br>

                <br><br><br>
                But the basic dad is not something to fear. I say we should embrace the basic. 
                These funny little stereotypes should be celebrated and enjoyed.
                And as a man, WHEN it finally happens to you, take pride in your dad-isms.
                Know that you are laying groundwork for future generations of Basic Dads. Just as your father did
                for you. And his father did for him. <br><br>
                What are some of the things that make a dad become a basic dad? <br><br>
                We hope you take some time exploring The Basic Dad website. <br>Learn about the basic dad, and maybe share some appreciation for him.</h2>
