      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Guys, have you ever worried about becoming a “basic dad?” Or that you may some day turn into your own dad? Whether you have no kids or several, the reality is that this could happen to you. Rather than fear the basic dad, I say that men should embrace this idea. As a father of 4 who struggled with these same types of questions, I have grown to love the quirkiness that is everything “dad.”
        My idea is simple. I want to create a site that is comical. One that will celebrate some of the fun eccentricities of the basic dad life. Perhaps in the future this could branch out into something more substantial or commercialized. However, to start, this would just be a fun and humorous fan-site to highlight the comedy of basic dads.
        </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p> Young Dads, Old Dads, and Prospective Dads are the main focus for the site.
        While the target audience here is dads, (especially those who are opposed to "basic dads" and "dad-isms") 
        this site could potentially appeal to anyone.
        Wives and children of dads may also find this site humorous.

      <h3>BASIC DAD- Embrace the Basic </h3>
      <p>
        Some of us had basic dads growing up. Some of us know basic dads now. Perhaps some of us have even slipped into being a basic dad without even knowing. 
         For many guys, as we age, there is some worry about becoming this “basic dad.” We want to be a good parent, but don’t want to fit that stereotype of a goofy or weird or boring dad; as seen on many television shows.
         Maybe we want to take some of the values and lessons taught by our own dads, but we don’t want to be like him. Telling lame jokes. Worried about trivial things such as our lawn, or barbecuing or the thermostat temperature in our house. 
         We want to be cooler, more modern, have better style. But the basic dad is not something to fear. I say we should embrace the basic. Embrace all of those wonderful and quirky things (or dad-isms) that make a dad, a dad. Whether you think they are basic or not. 
         These funny little stereo types should be celebrated and enjoyed. And as a man, WHEN it finally happens to you, take pride in your dad-isms. Know that you are laying groundwork for future generations of basic dads. Just as your father did for you. And his father did for him. And so on and so on. 
         But what are some of these basic dad-ism? What are some of the things that make a dad a basic dad? Lets explore just a few.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, a basic dad is a man of character. He is man of wisdom and experience. 
        He is a man of discipline. He is dependable. He has a good heart. He wants to be a good citizen and neighbor. 
        He may be somewhat embarrassing to his family but he loves his family and wants to be a role model for his kids. 
        The basic dad wants the world in his own little sphere of influence, to be a little bit better because of him. He is a good man.

      <h3>Top 10 Basic Dad-ism </h3>
      <p>
        This is in no way a comprehensive list of all of the basic dad-isms. But this a list of some of the 10 most common things all basic dads do. <br>

1.	Dad Jokes- Dad jokes are usually puns, or one-liners. Dad jokes are considered to be lame by most comedic standards. With the exception of maybe, other dads or real little kids. Don’t expect to get a standing ovation for these. However, it doesn’t matter. They are still funny to the basic dad. Dad jokes often get told and retold every time the occasion for one may arise.<br>
2.	Barbecue- Basic dads have to have their barbecue game on point. Whether it be burgers and hotdogs, or steaks. They are masters of the grill. Basic dads will barbecue in the sweltering summer heat or in a cold snow storm. Whenever the situation may arise, they are ready.<br>
3.	Lawn Care- The basic dad knows the ins and outs of lawn care. Keeping that lawn looking green is very important. He knows the best times water, when to fertilize and when to aerate. In relation, basic dads are often very concerned about which mower and trimmer to use. What works the best to meet the needs of their lawn. <br>
4.	The Thermostat- Don’t touch that thermostat, unless you want an angry lecture about it from your basic dad. The basic dad KNOWS what the optimum temperature for the house should be. And where the thermostat should be set at during any season. He knows how to keep the house at just the right temp and still keep his energy bill low. <br>
5.	Unfinished Home Improvements- Home improvements are an ongoing thing. Often times the basic dad has several “projects” he is working on. They may not ever be fully completed, and they may not be done perfectly. But the basic dad is a DIY guy. He’s always working on something. <br>
6.	Naps- Napping is often, an unappreciated art. Basic dads love their naps, but will often deny every being asleep if caught. Basic dads can fall asleep almost anywhere, anytime and in the most awkward places. Whether due to the physiological change of becoming older, or just because basic dads are often busy and thus low on sleep; it isn’t clear. But basic dads love “resting their eyes.”<br>
7.	Gas Prices- A somewhat controversial topic, especially in our current situation, a basic dad is very concerned about saving a few cents on gas. Often times the basic dad know which station has the lowest price in the area. And will often drive out of the way to a big box chain such as Costco or Sam’s Club, to fill up their vehicle. <br>
8.	Chatty- Often times the basic dad is a friendly fellow. He is willing to chat with just about anyone. From cashiers at the store to people walking their dogs in the neighborhood; the basic dad is happy to say hello when he is out and about. He can small talk with just about anyone, on just about anything, from politics to sports. Basic dads love superficial level socializing. <br>
9.	Advice- The basic dad knows (or thinks he knows) a little bit about almost everything. Often willing to dole out advice, whether wanted or not. A basic dad shares wisdom with others. And will pontificate about a variety of important issues. This may lead to long and somewhat boring stories of a time when he was younger.  <br>
10.	The Superhero- The basic dad is often required to perform acts of minor “superhuman” strength. Such as opening tough jars. Or carrying in the most amount of grocery bags from the car, with the least number of trips. The basic dad also has to be fearless and take on scary jobs such as killing spiders in the house. Though these tasks may seem trivial, a basic dad is capable to be a minor level superhero to his family.
